Once fully designed and developed, the Music Share application should work as follows:

The purpose of the Music Share application is to share what you’re listening to with your friends and followers. Through this application, users can have a visual representation of what their friends are listening to and can keep up with their friends as well as discover new music. The application is very similar to Instagram, but with a music focus.

The first page is the login page. This is where a user will enter their username and password to get into the site or create a new account. Once logged in, a user will see the main page - the news feed. This is just like Instagram, but the photos are album artwork. From this main page, users can click on their profile or the add a song button.

On the profile page, users can see their profile and all of the songs they’ve posted as well as a profile picture - again very similar to Instagram. 

Finally, users can add a song to their profile by adding a song through the button on the news feed.
